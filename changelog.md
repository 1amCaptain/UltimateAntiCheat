## Updates
- April 24, '24: IAT hook checking, further code cleanup and error checking
- April 7, '24: Added TestSigning / Windows 'test mode' detection to prevent unsigned drivers
- April 3, '24: Added WINAPI hook checking, blacklisted process checking
- March 31, '24: Detection methods have been moved to Detections class, techniques/prevention methods have been moved into Preventions class. Thus we have a set of detections and a set of preventions. Added detection looping to make the program feel more like a commercial AC. Code structure is closer now to where I had aimed originally. There's still much that can be added, stay tuned.
- March 25, '24: Beginning to move tests into their proper places and making use of the API class. Future updates will improve code structure and add threaded & looping support to make the program feel more like a commercial AC product and less like a techniques testing suite
- March 24, '24: A full re-upload was done along with various bug fixes. The program should compile without issues in x64 (x86 not supported yet, apologies). I plan on continuing work on this project in the near future. As it's been some time since making this project, lots more can be added soon with new knowledge and techniques acquired in the time between then and now. Stay tuned for further updates!
