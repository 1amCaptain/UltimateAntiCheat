# UltimateAntiCheat
Research project: make some elaborate anti-cheat to detect: memory editing, debugging, certificates (and spoofing), injected modules, multi-boxing, OS spoofing

Additionally, provide features such as:
Routines which could obfuscate the assembly of a pre-compiled module (on disk)


This project is on-going and worked on in whatever spare time I hav

If you have any suggestions feel free to raise an 'issue', thanks!
