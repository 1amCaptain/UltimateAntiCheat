# UltimateAntiCheat
Research project: make some elaborate anti-cheat to detect: memory editing, debugging, certificates (and spoofing), injected modules, multi-boxing, OS spoofing

Additionally, provide features such as:
Routines which could obfuscate the assembly of a pre-compiled module (on disk)

This project is on-going and worked on in whatever spare time I have, and is not intended to be commercial software. If you want to use any examples in your commercial software please contact me beforehand. If this gets far enough in development then a commercial 'plug and play' version will be made and possibly sold (or released as freeware) to be implemented in a/your game. 

If you have any design suggestions feel free to raise an 'issue', thanks!
