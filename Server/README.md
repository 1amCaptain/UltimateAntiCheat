# UltimateAntiCheat (SERVER): A server for UltimateAntiCheat built in C#

![ExampleOutput](https://github.com/AlSch092/UltimateAntiCheat/assets/94417808/8607553b-42b1-4bc4-ab1c-fa59d9eb4c8f)

## How to use:
Simply open & build the project using visual studio (originally made in VS2022), and allow the program through your private network firewall when the Windows prompt pops up. You can then run the UltimateAnticheat project (client) and it will attempt to connect to this server on port 5445.

## Requirements:
- Windows-based operating system
- Port 5445 must be unused (or this port changed in the `Program.cs` file

## Featurelist:
- Connected client tracking including hardware ID, remote IP, private network hostname
- Heartbeat mechanism every 60 seconds (in-progress)

## Notice:
A premium version of this software exists which has been load tested and has built-in database integration, along with improved readability, more detection features; thus this public version may be considered 'lacking' in various ways. The license fee is generally quite affordable and helps towards my basic living expenses. Please send me an e-mail if you're interested!
