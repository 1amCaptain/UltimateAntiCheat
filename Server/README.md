![Example](https://github.com/AlSch092/UltimateAntiCheat/assets/94417808/ae7450aa-4000-45eb-aeb8-e1efe951bc39)

## How to use:
Simply open & build the project using visual studio (originally made in VS2022), and allow the program through your private network firewall when the Windows prompt pops up. You can then run the UltimateAnticheat project and it will connect to this server.

## Requirements:
- Windows-based operating system
- Port 5445 must be unused (or this port changed in the `Program.cs` file

## Featurelist:
- Connected client tracking including hardware ID, remote IP, private network hostname
- Heartbeat mechanism every 60 seconds (in-progress)

## Notice:
This server is newly-made in comparison to the client, thus bugs will exist and some features may be lacking. This will improve with time.
